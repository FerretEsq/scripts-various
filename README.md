Various scripts you can use on different machines that automate different actions

## File descriptions
- zsh_aliases is a file in which I keep multiple comfortable aliases for long commands such as "updateme" for a full update+upgrade cycle, or "untar" for unpacking tar balls without having to remember. Can be easily converted to an alias file for any other shell environment as well, of course

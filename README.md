Various scripts you can use on different machines that automate different actions

## File descriptions
- [zsh_aliases](https://github.com/FerretEsq/scripts-various/blob/main/.zsh_aliases) is a Z-shell file in which I keep multiple comfortable aliases for long commands such as "updateme" for a full update+upgrade cycle, or "untar" for unpacking tar balls without having to remember the various flags. Can be easily converted to an alias file for any other shell environment as well, of course
